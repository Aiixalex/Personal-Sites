CandyKids is a program that candy factories generate candy to a bounded buffer while kids eat candy from the bounded buffer.

Candykids program uses the producer-consumer solution to manage access to a bounded buffer storing candy. One group of threads will model candy factories which generate candy one at a time and insert the candy into the bounded buffer. Another group of threads will model kids which eat candy one a time from the bounded buffer.

## Install

Install the repository.

```shell
$ make
$ ./candykids
```

## Usage

Candykids accept three arguments:

```shell
./candykids <#factories> <#kids> <#seconds>

Example:
$ ./candykids 5 2 8
# Factories: Number of candy-factory threads to spawn.
# Kids: Number of kid threads to spawn.
# Seconds: Number of seconds to allow the factory thread to run for.
```

### Main Function

1. Extract arguments: Process the arguments passed on the command line.
2. Initialize modules: Do any module initialization.
3. Launch factory threads: Spawn the requested number of candy-factory threads.
4. Launch kid threads: Spawn the requested number of kid threads.
5. Wait for requested time: Call sleep().
6. Stop factory threads: Indicate to the factory threads that they are to finish, and then call join for each factory thread.
7. Wait until no more candy
8. Stop kid threads: For each kid thread, cancel the thread and then join the thread.
9. Print statistics
10. Cleanup any allocated memory
